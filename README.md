## Remote Assignment V3

How To Build & Run (from downloaded files):

To build the server, first ensure that the GOPATH is set to where 
you downloaded this .zip from GitHub. Additionally, your PATH variable needs to 
contain $GOPATH/bin. Then, from the top-level directory run "go install main". 
Lastly, run "main" to start the server.

How To Build & Run (as a Docker container from terminal):

Step 1. Run "docker pull jl1992/gawkbox"<br />
Step 2. Run "docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 jl1992/gawkbox"

The application will be running on localhost:8080

Request/Response Flow:

To obtain the information specified in the remote assignment in JSON format, 
navigate to the route "localhost:8080/users/USERNAME", where USERNAME is the name 
of the Twitch user whose data you wish to access. The HTTP response will be in
JSON format with appropriate headers added for readability.
